# Power BI visuals and reports

For each project, there will be a PDF file to have a look at report in a static way and a .mov video which is a dynamic file to have a look at features in more depth.

Since GitHub doesn't open big files you might need to click on 'see raw file' when open .mov files to view the video (10-15 seconds videos usually).
